# Intro to Schnorr in ZKP

Schnorr signatures are a type of digital signature scheme that is widely used in cryptography. They are known for their simplicity, efficiency, and strong security properties. In the context of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), Schnorr signatures play a crucial role in enabling secure and private transactions.

This document provides an overview of Schnorr signatures, their properties, and their applications in zero-knowledge proofs. We will cover the following topics:
