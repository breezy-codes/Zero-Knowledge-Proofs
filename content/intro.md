# Zero Knowledge Proofs

Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a powerful cryptographic tool that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value without revealing the value itself. This concept is particularly useful in scenarios where privacy and security are paramount.

ZKPs have gained significant attention in recent years, especially in the context of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. They enable secure transactions, enhance privacy, and facilitate trustless interactions between parties.
