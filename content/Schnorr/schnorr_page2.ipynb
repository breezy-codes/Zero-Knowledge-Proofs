    "# Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Digital Forensics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In digital forensics, investigators are often required to prove the integrity, existence, or possession of digital evidence without disclosing its full content.  \n",
    "Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a cryptographic framework that can satisfy such requirements, enabling **privacy-preserving evidence verification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Proof of File Possession\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigator may wish to demonstrate that they possess a specific file (e.g., illegal media, encrypted evidence) without revealing the file contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a ZKP (such as a Schnorr-style commitment on the file hash), the investigator can prove knowledge of the file without revealing any part of it.\n",
    "- This satisfies both privacy regulations and chain-of-custody integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- File $F$.\n",
    "- Compute $h = H(F)$ using a secure hash function $H$.\n",
    "- Prove knowledge of preimage of $h$ using a zero-knowledge identification scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Integrity Verification without Disclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "When presenting forensic findings to courts, investigators must verify that evidence has not been altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZKPs allow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verifying that a dataset matches an original record without disclosing sensitive metadata.\n",
    "- Demonstrating that private information was correctly processed according to lawful warrants without revealing non-relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Privacy-Preserving Chain-of-Custody Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-custody logs can be enhanced with zero-knowledge proofs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prove that a log entry occurred without exposing the full data.\n",
    "- Validate signatures on chain-of-custody events without revealing the event contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly relevant for sensitive investigations (e.g., involving minors, corporate espionage).\n",
    "\n",
