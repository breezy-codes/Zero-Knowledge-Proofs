    "# Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Digital Forensics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In digital forensics, investigators often face the challenge of proving the integrity, existence, or possession of digital evidence without exposing its sensitive content.  \n",
    "Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) provide a cryptographic framework that addresses this challenge, enabling **privacy-preserving evidence verification**. By leveraging ZKPs, investigators can ensure compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining the integrity of the forensic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed discussion on the mathematical foundations of ZKPs, refer to [Introduction to Schnorr](schnorr_1.ipynb). This section focuses on their applicability in digital forensics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Proof of File Possession\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigator may need to demonstrate possession of a specific file (e.g., illegal media, encrypted evidence) without revealing its content. ZKPs, such as Schnorr-style commitments on file hashes, enable this capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The investigator computes a secure hash of the file, $h = H(F)$, using a cryptographic hash function $H$.\n",
    "- Using a zero-knowledge identification scheme, they prove knowledge of the preimage of $h$ (i.e., the file $F$) without disclosing $F$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures privacy by not exposing the file content.\n",
    "- Maintains chain-of-custody integrity while complying with privacy regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Integrity Verification without Disclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "When presenting forensic findings in court, investigators must prove that evidence has not been tampered with, often without revealing sensitive details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ZKP Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verifies that a dataset matches the original record without exposing sensitive metadata.\n",
    "- Demonstrates that private information was processed lawfully (e.g., under a warrant) without revealing irrelevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enhances trust in forensic processes while safeguarding sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Privacy-Preserving Chain-of-Custody Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-custody logs are critical in forensic investigations, but they often contain sensitive information. ZKPs can enhance these logs by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proving that a log entry occurred without exposing its full details.\n",
    "- Validating signatures on chain-of-custody events without revealing the event contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigations involving sensitive subjects (e.g., minors, corporate espionage).\n",
    "- Situations where privacy regulations require minimal data exposure."
